# Aquarius Master System

This is an alternative FPGA core for the Aquarius+ that implements an 8-bit game console.

The Master System was an 8-bit game console from a vendor that is well known for its blue hedgehog.

It is not designed to be 100% accurate and only implements those parts of the hardware that are actually needed for the games to run.

NTSC games up to 512KB are supported.
