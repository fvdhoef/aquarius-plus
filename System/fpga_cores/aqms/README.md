# Aquarius Master System

This is an alternative FPGA core for the Aquarius+ that implements an 8-bit game console.

The Master System was an 8-bit game console from a vendor that is well known for its blue hedgehog.

It only implements those parts of the hardware that are actually needed for the games to run.

NTSC games up to 512KB are supported.
